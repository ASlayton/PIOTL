## PUT IT ON THE LIST
Have you ever opened the refrigerator door, just to have a flurry of postit notes fly off and over-burdened magnets slowly slip down until they eventually make thier way under the refrigerator? You probably have an over-abundance of honey-do's and remnants of grocery lists that you will not find until long after they are no longer relevant. Look no further, there is now an app for that.
