## PUT IT ON THE LIST
Have you ever opened the refridgerator door, just to have a flurry of postit notes fly off and overly burdened magnets slowly slip down until they eventually make thier way under the refrigerator? You probably have an over-abundance of honey-do's and remnants of grocery lists that you will not find until long after they are no longer relevant. Look no further, there is now an app for that. Just sign in, create your family profile, and you will have room for all of those pictures that always seem to be disappearing.
